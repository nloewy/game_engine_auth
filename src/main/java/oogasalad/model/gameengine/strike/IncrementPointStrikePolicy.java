/**
 * The IncrementPointStrikePolicy class is a concrete implementation of the StrikePolicy interface
 * which has a strike policy that increases the temporary score of a GameObject that is both
 * scoreable and strikeable.
 * <p>
 * This class utilizes the Optional type to handle cases where the strikeable might not have a
 * corresponding scoreable component. By using Optional, it avoids potential NullPointerExceptions
 * that might occur if attempting to directly invoke methods on a null reference. If the strikeable
 * is also a scoreable, the temporary score is incremented. Otherwise, no action is taken.
