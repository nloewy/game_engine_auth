## Use Cases

## Doga's Use Cases

### User Selects a Game Mode

* The main menu presents options for different game modes (e.g., Pool, Air Hockey).
* User interaction with the menu leads to the selection of a game mode, and the frontend loads the
  appropriate game interface.

```java
public class MainMenuUI {

  public void displayGameOptions() {
    // Display game mode options on the screen
  }

  public void handleGameSelection(int selectedGameMode) {
    switch (selectedGameMode) {
      case POOL_GAME:
        loadPoolGameUI();
        break;
      case AIR_HOCKEY_GAME:
        loadAirHockeyGameUI();
        break;
      // Add cases for other games
    }
  }
}

```

### User Interacts with Game Space

* The game space (field, table, etc.) is interactive, allowing for direct user actions like aiming
  and shooting.
* The frontend captures user inputs (clicks, drags: for power of hit) and translates them into
  in-game actions.

```java
public class GameSpaceUI {

  public void initializeGameSpace() {
    // Set up interactive game space
  }

  public void handleUserInput() {
    // Translate user input into game actions
  }
}

```

### User Encounters and Overcomes Obstacles

* The game dynamically presents obstacles within the game space.
* The user must navigate or interact with these obstacles, with the UI providing feedback on success
  or failure.
* This is testing the idea of maybe having an auditory compnent so that when the ball strikes an
  obstacle, a sound is played

```java
public class ObstacleUI {

  public void displayObstacles() {
    // Render obstacles on the game space
  }

  public void handleCollisionWithObstacles() {
    // Provide visual and auditory feedback on collisions
  }
}

```

### User Aims and Shoots a Shot/Hit

* For games requiring aim and power mechanisms (like pool, and potentially mini golf and air
  hockey) , the UI provides controls for setting direction and strength.
  The system visualizes the aim path and responds to the execution command.

```java
public class ShotControllerUI {

  public void displayAimControls() {
    // Show aim direction and power adjustment UI
  }

  public void executeShot(double direction, double power) {
    // Visual feedback on the shot path and result
  }
}

```

### User Takes Turns in Multiplayer Mode

* For when we implement active multiplayer (ex: air hockey).
* The UI indicates the active player and turn status in multiplayer sessions.
* Controls are enabled or disabled based on the turn, ensuring players act at the correct times.

```java
public class TurnManagementUI {

  public void indicateActivePlayer(int playerId) {
    // Highlight the UI elements for the active player
  }

  public void toggleControlAccessibility(boolean isTurn) {
    // Enable or disable controls based on whether it's the user's turn
  }
}
```

### User Progresses Through Levels or Rounds

* The frontend displays level/round information, tracking progression within the selected game.
* Transitions between levels or rounds are handled and UI elements update accordingly.

```java
public class LevelProgressionUI {

  public void displayCurrentLevel(int level) {
    // Show current level or round info to the user
  }

  public void transitionToNextLevel() {
    // Animate and load the next level or round
  }
}

```

### Noah's Use Cases (nl190)

1. **During gameplay, when the golf ball collides with a wall or other solid collidable object.**

- **Actions:**
    - The collision should cause the golf ball to inelastic off the wall or paddle, simulating a
      inelastic.
    - The wall or paddle remains unaffected, preserving its immutability within the game
      environment.

2. **When the golf ball sufficiently enters the hole.**

- **Actions:**
    - The golf ball's motion halts as its velocity is reduced to zero.
    - The ball becomes invisible, representing its placement within the hole.
    - The player's score increments by one stroke, signifying successful completion.
    - The scoreboard updates to reflect the updated player scores.
    - The game progresses to the next hole or initiates the next player's turn.

3. **Following the execution of a stroke by a player, once the golf ball stops moving.**

- **Actions:**
    - The stroke contributes to the active player's score.
    - The scoreboard updates to reflect the change in scores.
    - The active player transitions to an inactive status.
    - The next player becomes active, initiating their turn in the gameplay sequence.

4. **When the golf ball collides with a water hazard during gameplay.**

- **Actions:**
    - The stroke is added to the active player's score.
    - The scoreboard updates to reflect the updated scores.
    - The golf ball's position is reset to its previous location.
    - The ball's velocity is reduced to zero, indicating a stoppage in motion.
    - The turn concludes, and the active status of players is adjusted accordingly.

5. **When a new player creates an account and joins a pre-existing league and plays his first
   league
   game.**

- **Actions:**
    - The player's username, password, and id is added to the `Players` Database
    - The player's id is added to the `members` column of the `Leagues` Database
    - The game results, referencing both player's ids, as well as the league's id, is added to
      the `Games` Database, so it can be included in future standings queries.

6. **A User manually clicks the `pause` button and then later resumes the game with the `resume
   button`. The game designer, forseeing this, implemented a rule that the game cannot be paused
   by a user more than 3 times.
   does this.**

- **Actions**:
    - When the paused button is clicked, one of two things can happen.
        - If the player who clicked pause is currently the active player, a splash screen will be
          shown to the user, with a `resume` option
        - If an inactive player clicks pause, or the player has used all 3 pauses, nothing will
          happen.
    - The objects stop moving while the pause splash screen is displayed
    - When the `resume` button is clicked, the objects will resume moving with the same
      properties as before the pause.

[//]: # (- **Actions**:)

[//]: # (    - When the paused button is clicked, one of two things can happen.)

[//]: # (        - If the player who clicked pause is currently the active player, a splash screen will be)

[//]: # (          shown to the user, with a `resume` option)

### Kevin Uses Cases
1. How does a user load a game? 
   - Clicking on the play game button from splash screen pulls up a window with a list of existing games as seen in the directory. The user can select one to construct a game window with.
2. What if the user tries to click on the ball in a game that only uses WASD?
   - The input is caught by the Game Window manager, and passed into the control scheme class to map to a backend command. If no such command exists, it defaults to null and nothing even goes to backend.
3. What if the user tries to author a game with a ball clipped into a wall?
   - The ball will be displayed clipped into the wall because the ball will be inside the wall on the model side. It may be dislodged with a great enough velocity, though.
4. How does the author specify when a ball is destroyed?
   - In the authoring environment, the author can select a number of events to occur whenever a specific collision occurs. In the case of a ball hitting a hole of some sort, the author might add the "increase score by one" event as well as the "disable ball" event.
5. What happens when the ball stops moving?
   - A check for stagnancy occurs at every update call, at which point various user conditions are checked and the game progresses according to any passing conditions.
6. The user clicks a button while the game is receiving mouse click input.
   - The mouse click is ignored from the game's perspective and is only received by the buttons. Game input is area locked, so the mouse must be within frame for mouse input to count.

## Alisha's Use Cases 

1. **User runs the authoring program and saves a new game they made**
- **Steps:**
    - The authoring frontend calls the builder method for each field of all the game info (collidables, players, rules, etc.)
    - The builder in the backend serializes the information into JSON.
    - The backend will be using a builder pattern to build each field of the JSON separately

2. **User saved a new game in the authoring environment with one field left empty**
- **Steps:**
    - The authoring frontend calls the builder method for each field of all the game info (collidables, players, rules, etc.) passing the empty field in as the default value according to the game type
    - The backend builder builds the information into JSON as normal

3. **User runs a game with invalid color rgb values in the data file/json**
- **Steps:**
    - (This would only happen when user went in and manually edited the JSON or data files before running the game because the authoring environment itself will be restricting the possible values the user could enter to be within the valid rgb value range)
    - The color information for each object will be read by the parser and into a data/config file for the frontend to access
    - When the parser reads the data (or when the frontend uses the color data) it would check whether the rgb values are valid 
    - Throws an error warning the user that the data file has a problem that need to be fixed if it's invalid (too low or too high) and also defaults the invalid value to the closet valid value (negative numbers to 0, numbers that are too large to 255) so that the game frontend could still run

4. **In a game of air hockey, when a player hits the puck into a goal and reaches 10 points (the game was preset to end when one of the players reaches 10 points)**
- **Steps:**
    - The game manager's onCollision() method checks in the collision condition map for what needs to happen after the collision of the puck with that goal
    - The specific rules are made by the parser upon initialization and is saved in the rule record
    - Adds a point to the player who hit the puck, 
    - Logic manager checks for whether the turn/game policy is satisfied. 
    - Since it is, then execute what needs to happen at the end of a game.

5. **When user moved the controller and hits the air hockey puck**
- **Steps:**
    - The frontend detects the movement of the controller object
    - frontend checks coordinates for whether a collision has happened
    - frontend passes the collision and the object ids that collided to backend game engine.
    - game engine calls oncollide to handle the collision (the controller gives the ball a velocity to move)

6. **When in pinball the ball travels along a speedup zone on the game scene**
- **Steps:**
    - The game scene is abstracted as another collidable object with friction
    - Upon contact of the speed-up zone and the ball it would be handled by the engine as a collision that increases the ball's velocity

## Judy's Use Cases
1. Configuring a new game
- **Steps**
  1. User defines the parameters of the new game through dropdown menus. 
  2. User add any objects/obstacles to the new game through a drag/drop mechanism 
  3. View calls implementations of GameBuilder (following the Builder design pattern) to create JSON objects for policies, conditions, collidables and players. 
  4. New JSON is created for the new game 
  5. Model parses the new JSON file to configure new game in the backend 
2. Mini golf: when golf ball goes into hole
- **Steps**
  1. View detects collision between Collidables hole and golf ball, identified by their ids.
  2. View passes collision and ids of Collidables to GameEngine
  3. Based on the game configuration, the GameEngine process the activity and returns the correct response to the View

3. Load pre-configured game 
- Steps
  1. View calls GameParser to parse existing JSON file for configuring a new game
  2. GameParser calls GameEngine to configure the backend states for the new game

4. Air hockey: Attempt to move puck pass half line
- Steps
  1. View detects "collision" between half line and puck and passes the collision and colliding entities to GameEngine by id. 
  2. Given collision and types of the Collidables identified by their id, the GameEngine follows pre-defined policies to return the correct response to View.
  3. View disables functionality for moving the puck further forward pass the half line

5. Mini golf: golf is shot out of bound or into water
- Steps
  1. View detects collision between game environment boundary/water and golf ball, passing the collision and colliding entities to GameEngine by id.
  2. Given collision and types of the Collidables identified by their id, the GameEngine follows pre-defined policies to return the correct response to View. 
  3. GameEngine resets the game in the backend.
  4. View resets the game for the frontend (player, golfball back to starting position).

6. Air hockey: Player A scores a goal.
- Steps 
  1. View detects collision between player B's goal and air hockey, passing the collision and colliding entities to GameEngine by id.
  2. Given collision and types of the Collidables identified by their id, the GameEngine follows pre-defined policies to return the correct response to View.
  3. GameEngine updates player A's score and checks win and turn conditions.  
  4. GameEngine resets the game in the backend.
  5. If a win condition has been reached, the View generates new splash screen displaying the game result. Otherwise, View updates player A's score and resets the game for the frontend (pucks, hockey back to starting position).
